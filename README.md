(also on how to build the driver)

Right now, basic WIFI functionality is all there is. Once the packets sent to the gamepads are known and understood, a wrapper-driver can connect various already available open source usb gamepad drivers like xpad with the wireless interface. The wrapper driver is the main reason for this repository.

This is work in progress.
